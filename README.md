# TurquoiseBL - UEFI Bootloader

## What ?

TurquoiseBL is a UEFI bootloader that aims to be future proof, easy to use and heavily customizable.

## Why ?

Because SnoozOS needs a bootloader and I don't want to to bundle GRUB or Limine.

## Who ?

> WIP Actually nobody, it's not stable and doesn't have enough features yet.

Anyone! From OSDevs to simple users who want a nice bootloader.

## How ?

> WIP

## Known issues

- Can't use VMWare or Qemu but works fine on an actual machine.
